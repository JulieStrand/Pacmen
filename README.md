# Pacmen
## Add Pacmen to the screen and then watch them go <br>
<img src="pacmen.png"><br>
In this version, the user can add Pac-men to the screen with a button click, and another button puts them all into motion at random speeds, moving in two dimensions along both the x- and y-axes, reversing directions when they reach the edge of the window. I'm currently working on getting the Pacmen to open and close their mouths and change their images dynamically to the correct direction when they hit the right and left sides of the window. Those initial attempts are included as comments, but I haven't yet completed that part of the code. As it is now, the Pacmen move about the screen as a static image, facing right with their mouths open.

To use the application, click "Add PacMan" to add a Pacman to the screen, then click "Start Game" to set them in motion. You can continue to add Pacmen to the screen with the "Add PacMan" button after the game has been started.
